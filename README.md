# Exe File Library Parser

## Introduction
Welcome to the Exe File Library Parser project! This is a simple C++ program developed using WinAPI to parse an executable (exe) file and view the libraries (DLLs) used by the program. The program calculates the entropy of the exe file and the icon file associated with it.

## Installation
To use the program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/WinApiParsExe.git

markdown
Copy code

2. **Build the project:**  
Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or compiler that supports WinAPI (such as Visual Studio). Build the project to generate the executable file.

3. **Run the program:**  
After building the project, run the executable file. You will be prompted to enter the full path of the exe file and the associated icon file. The program will then parse the exe file, display the libraries used, calculate the entropy of the files, and update the icon file with the calculated entropy.

## Usage
- Enter the full path of the exe file when prompted.
- Enter the full path of the icon file associated with the exe file when prompted.
- The program will display the libraries (DLLs) used by the exe file.
- The program will calculate the entropy of the exe file and the associated icon file.
- The program will update the icon file with the calculated entropy.
